  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/food_images/
    - assets/onboarding_images/
    - assets/utiles/
    - assets/images_groceries/
    - assets/Groceries_bannner_images/
    - assets/homepage/
    - assets/Offers/
    - assets/homepage/banner/
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: MonaSans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Mona-Sans.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Mona-Sans-Bold.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Mona-Sans-ExtraBold.ttf
    - family: Quicksand
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Quicksand-Light.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Quicksand-Medium.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Quicksand-Regular.ttf
        # - asset: fonts/Quicksand-SemiBold.ttf
